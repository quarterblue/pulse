## About

Pulse is an easy-to-use hybrid failure detection library based on simple heartbeat message exchanges overlayed on a gossip protocol. Failure detectors were proposed by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/226643.226647">Chandra and Toueg</a> used to solve consensus in asynchronous systems with crash failures. In a fully asynchronous system, a failure detector is impossible to operate. But with time bounds (RTT) we can reasonably suspect a crashed node as failed. The simplest way to build a failure detector would be send and receive heartbeat messages among all nodes in the network.

The problem with heartbeat-based FD is that it is not scalable. Every node in the network exchanges heartbeat message with other nodes, causing the network load to reach an order of O(n^2). For small number of nodes, <= 100, this is a perfectly acceptable way of communicating. However, as the numbers begin to escalate, >= 1000 we are exchanging 1,000,000+ messages! This is where gossip protocol helps us reduce the network load to an order of O(n). In a gossip protocol, every node chooses a random node to (gossip) exchange message with and piggybacks status of other nodes it knows about <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public_pdfs/SWIM.pdf">(SWIM)</a>. 

Pulse uses a simple heartbeat protocol when the number of nodes involved are small (<= 100). As the number of nodes grows (customizable by the user), the nodes start disseminating gossip style messages to relay their liveliness. An individual node can opt to keep a heartbeat protocol to receive RTT bounded updates for nodes of their choosing, but the rest of the node discovery will be done via gossip message exchange.

ðŸš§ The project is still in <b>early development</b>, expect bugs, safety issues, and components that don't work

## Features

- Easy to use
- Minimalistic & simple architecture
- Heartbeat sensors (Pulses)
- Based on Gossip protocol
- Dynamic RTT calculation
- Eventually perfect weakly consistent FD
- Easily customizable
- REST API for status updates


## Installation

To install in Unix:

```shell
$ cd projectdir/
$ go get github.com/quarterblue/pulse
```

Import into your Go project:

```go
import (
  	"github.com/quarterblue/pulse"
)
```


## Usage

Pulser implementions the following interface:

```go
// Pulser is a node that responds to pulse requests
type Pulser interface {
	// Starts responding to the pulse requests on IP Address: ipAddr and Port: port
	StartPulseRes(ipAddr, port string) error

	// Stops responding to pulse requests
	StopPulseRes()
}
```

Coordinator implementions the following interface:

```go
// Coordinator is a node that requests pulse response from a map of nodes
type Coordinator interface {
	// Add an IP Address: ipAddr, Port: port to the monitor list and start asking for pulses
	AddPulser(ipAddr, port string, maxRetry, delay int, wg sync.WaitGroup) error

	// Remove IP Address: ipAddr, Port: port from the monitor list and stop asking for pulses
	RemovePulser(ipAddr, port string) error

	// Collectively stop monitoring all pulsers
	StopAllPulser()

	// Collectively start all pulsers added to monitor list
	StartAllPulser() error

	// Get the current status of a specific Node identified by Identifier
	Status(id Identifier) (Status, error)

	// Get the current status of all Nodes
	StatusAll() ([]*Status, error)
}
```

Full node implementions the Pulser and Coordinator along with Gossip() and StopGossip():

```go
// Pulser and Coordinator functions are indepedent, but can also be used together as a Full node
type FullNode interface {
	Pulser
	Coordinator
	Gossip()
	StopGossip()
}
```

To initialize and add a Pulser

```go
package main

import (
        "log"
	"sync"
        "github.com/quarterblue/pulse"
)

func main() {
	// capacitySize indicates the buffer count for channel that delivers the notification for failed nodes
        capacitySize := 10
	
	// Initialize returns the Pulser node, NotificationStream (channel) and err
        p, nStream, err := Initialize(capacitySize)
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
	
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)
	
	ipAddr := "82.165.205.136"
	port := "3005"
	maxRetry := 3
	delay := 2
	
	err = p.AddPulser(ipAddr, port, maxRetry, delay, wg)
        
        if err != nil {
                log.Fatal(err)
        }
	
	// Channel to receive failure messages
	go func(stream chan FailureMessage) {
		// Do logic for failure n
		log.Println(<-stream)
	}(nStream)
	
	// Start a REST API server
	go HttpAPI(p, 7001, "Development")
	
	wg.Wait()
}
```
